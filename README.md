## I am a front end developer 👩🏻‍💻

I love human and tech languages. At the university I studied translation and Interpreting and I learned English 🇬🇧 and French 🇫🇷 for years.
I have even studied some Romanian 🇷🇴 and Spanish sign language 🧏‍♀️ , so now I am focusing on learning tech languages with the same passion.

After I discovered that I actually loved coding I decided to study a bootcamp to become a front end developer and...here am I!

Below you can check some of the projects that I started during the course, remember that some of them are not finished yet, but I am working on them. Comments and improvements are welcome!

### About me

I am from Spain 🇪🇸 and I live in Madrid.

In my free time I love reading 📚 about nutrition and psychology (but I also enjoy a good novel!), watching good horror movies 💀, wandering around the city or the nature 🍂, playing board games 🎲, doing handcrafts ✂️ and I am a total nerd of vegan cooking! 🥦
